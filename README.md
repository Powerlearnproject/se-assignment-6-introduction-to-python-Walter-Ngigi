# SE-Assignment-6
 Assignment: Introduction to Python
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of Python programming. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Python Basics:
   - What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? Provide examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective.
  
   - python is a programming language,it is one of the most used programming language in the world. Some of it's key features that make ir popular among developers is it's simple syntax, it's easy to read and therefore easy to understand which makes it  a good first language for developers. It also has a wide variety of application and it's not limited to a specific domain or area of software development, this flexibility is part of why it is popular since it can be used for anything, from web development to data analysis to even game development. Python is written line by line making it easier to debug, not to mention that it can also be used in various operating systems such as Windows, Mac and Linux.

2. Installing Python:
   - Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.
Python can be downloaded through the "Pyhton.org" website. The website gives clear instructions and guidlines for the installation process, including how and where to download python for various operating systems. Once downloaded, you need to set up the virtual environment, for this you need to go to "environment variable" control panel and add the path to Python. After this is done you need to go to your code editor of choice eg. Visual Studio Code which is conscidered the industry standard. In your code editor you need to dowload the Python extensions.
To verify the installation, you open command prompt and enter the command "python --ver" if the install and set up was succesfull this command should give your python version as the output.

3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.
   -                   STEP ONE, WRITING THE CODE
   -  To write this simple program first we need to go to our code editor eg, visual studio code, then click new file and choose python file in the drop menu that pops up.
   -  The next part will be writing the actual code fot the program which is
   -          print("Hello, World!")
   - after writing the code and checking that there are no errors in your code, click run program from the top right button that looks like a "play" button. This action will run your program in the terminal and display your message.
   -                   BASIC SYNTAX ELEMENTS USED
   - The first syntax element is the print function this ouputs data to the console. 
   - The second syntax element is the quotation, this can be single or single.The quotation marks represent the string literals. a string can contain letters, numbers or symbols. Tripple 
     quotation marks can be used to define multiple line strings.
     The third syntax element is, The parentheses () , they are used to enclose the arguments passed to the print() function.

4. Data Types and Variables:
   -1. List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.
   -                  BASIC DATA TYPES USED IN PYTHON
   - 2.STRINGS ('str'): strings contain letters, numbers or symbols enclosed in quotation marks.
   - 3.INTEGER ('int'): This are whole numbers. This can be positive or negative.
   -4. FLOATING POINT (float): This are numbers with decimal points.
   -5.OLEANS ('bool'): Booleans represent truth values, they can either be true or false.
   -6. LIST:('list'): This represents an ordred changable collection of items. It is denoted by square brackets [], a 'list' can be changed, we can add remove or modify the contents of 
     this data type.
   7.TUPLE ('tuple'): Just like lists, tuples contain a collection of items, but unlike lists, this cannot be changed or modified after implementation. they are denoted by the 
     parenthesis().
   8. SET ('set'):  A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. * Note: Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new items. Sets are 
     denoted 
     by curly brackets {} or by using the 'set()' function when creating an empty seTt.
   9.DICTIONARY ('dict'):Unordered, mutable collection of key-value pairs.Example: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}

5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.

6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.

7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.

8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.

9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.

10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.

# Submission Guidelines:
- Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
- Provide code snippets or complete scripts where applicable.
- Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
- Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
